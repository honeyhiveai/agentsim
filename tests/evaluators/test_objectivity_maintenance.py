                Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the objectivity of the response to the input displayed below. Your evaluation should be based on the mentioned criteria. Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation on how the output performs relative to the input. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 by strictly following this JSON format: '{"rating": rating}, for example: '{"rating": 2}.
                [Criteria]

                Rate the objectivity of the response, with 5 being highly objective and 1 being not objective at all.
